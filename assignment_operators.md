 ## Assignment operators 
    In JavaScript are operators that allow you to assign values to variables,
    as well as perform various operations on those variables in a single expression.
 
 ### Core Assignment Operators:

    = — Simple assignment (the main operator)
    += — Addition assignment
    -= — Subtraction assignment
    *= — Multiplication assignment
    /= — Division assignment
    %= — Remainder (modulo) assignment

#### Example using only the core assignment operators:

```let a = 10;
    a += 5;  // a is now 15
    a -= 2;  // a is now 13
    a *= 2;  // a is now 26
    a /= 4;  // a is now 6.5
    a %= 3;  // a is now 0.5
